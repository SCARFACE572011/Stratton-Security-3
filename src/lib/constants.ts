export const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What areas does Stratton Security Group serve?",
    a: "Stratton Security Group is headquartered in Los Angeles and operates statewide across California. We deploy patrol, guard, and specialized security services across LA County, Beverly Hills, Southern California, and adjacent markets.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is Stratton Security Group licensed and insured?",
    a: "Yes. Stratton holds California PPO License #122163 issued by the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services. All officers are individually licensed, and the company is fully bonded and insured.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between armed and unarmed officers?",
    a: "Armed officers carry an additional Exposed Firearm Permit and complete live-fire qualification on a defined cadence; they are appropriate for environments with elevated threat profiles. Unarmed officers provide the same professional presence and training for environments where an armed posture is not required or desired. Stratton helps you select the right posture during the risk assessment.",
  },
  {
    q: "How quickly can Stratton deploy to a new property?",
    a: "For standard deployments we can typically begin coverage within 72 hours of contract signing. For urgent incidents we have mobilized teams in under 24 hours. A Stratton advisor will confirm timing during your initial consultation.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are Stratton officers LAPD trained?",
    a: "Stratton's roster includes officers with current and former LAPD experience. All Stratton officers — LAPD-credentialed or not — complete our internal training program, which exceeds California's minimum requirements and includes TEAM certification, CPR/First Aid, and Power to Arrest.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you provide security for one-time events?",
    a: "Yes. Stratton's event security program supports galas, conferences, weddings, private events, and venue-wide functions. We advance the venue, size the team appropriately, and deliver a post-event debrief. Start a conversation on the Contact page.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer unarmed-only or plainclothes options?",
    a: "Yes. Stratton deploys unarmed uniformed officers, plainclothes teams (common in retail loss prevention and hospitality), and concierge-style lobby ambassadors. The posture is always matched to the property and the risk profile.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does Stratton handle incident reporting?",
    a: "Every incident is documented digitally with timestamps, photos when relevant, and written narrative. Clients receive regular reports on a cadence agreed to during program setup — daily for high-security operations, weekly or monthly for ongoing patrol programs. Supervisors are reachable 24/7.",
  },
  {
    q: "What training do Stratton officers receive?",
    a: "All active officers complete California's mandatory Power to Arrest curriculum, First Aid & CPR certification, and TEAM (Techniques for Effective Alcohol Management) certification. New officers complete Stratton's initial officer training covering post orders, communication, reporting, and conduct standards. See the Training page for more.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can Stratton customize a program to my specific property?",
    a: "Yes — and we strongly recommend it. No two properties are identical. Stratton starts every engagement with a risk assessment and designs a tailored program based on your facility, risk profile, and operational requirements.",
